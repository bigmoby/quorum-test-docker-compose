# Testing dockerized geth and constellation

This tests the experimental setup to have geth (based on go-ethereum) and constellation run in separate docker instances, but in pairs such that each geth docker instance communicates with its corresponding constellation node docker instance via IPC instead of TCP.


## Generate configuration artifacts and docker-compose.yaml

```
./setup.sh
```

The *setup.sh* script creates a basic Quorum network with Raft consensus. There's a whole bunch of things it needs to do in order to achieve this, some specific to Quorum, some common to private Ethereum chains in general.

1. bootnode
A bootnode is used in the network so that the geth nodes does not attempt to contact the well-known nodes in the public networks during p2p discovery. The script generates a node key for the bootnode and calculates its public address to be used in the geth node's `--bootnodes` argument.

2. for each geth node
The script generates all configuration files for the geth node in the `ethereum` folder. Inside the folder:

 * *nodekey* file to uniquely identify this node on the network.
 * *static-nodes.json* file that lists the Enode IDs of nodes that participate in the initial Raft cluster. Additional nodes can be added to the Raft cluster which is described [here](#adding-new-nodes-to-an-existing-network).
 * *permissioned-nodes.json* file that captures the list of Enode IDs allowed to connect to each other in this network instance.
 * Ether accounts are generated in the *keystore* directory
   * The accounts get written into the *genesis.json* file with an initial balance

3. for each constellation node
 * the transaction manager's identity (key pair) in tm.pub and tm.key files
 * the tm.conf file that configures the constellation node for url and listening port, and where other constellation nodes are

4. docker-compose.yaml
This makes it trivial to launch the network

Refer to the *setup.sh* file itself for the full code.

## Launch the network

```
docker-compose -f tmp/docker-compose.yaml up
```

## Advanced Topics

### Configuration options

Options are simple and self-explanatory. The *docker-compose.yml* file will create a Docker network for the nodes as per the `subnet` variable here. If you want to run more nodes, then add addresses for them to the `ips` list.

    #### Configuration options #############################################

    # One Docker container will be configured for each IP address in $ips
    subnet="172.13.0.0/16"
    ips=("172.13.0.3" "172.13.0.5" "172.13.0.7")


**Note:** The setup.sh uses the IP addresses above for the quorum instances, the corresponding constellation instances will use the quorum's IP address minus 1 for its IP address. As a result, the list of IPs for the quorum nodes must be separated by at least 2.

### Quorum configuration directory structure

The configuration files for the geth and constellation nodes in Quorum are saved under the `ethereum` and `constellation` directories respectively:

    /qdata/
    ├── ethereum/
    │   ├── geth/
    │   ├── keystore/
    │   │   └── UTC--2017-10-21T12-49-26.422099203Z--aad5479aff498c9258b21b59dd7546262aa2cfc7
    │   ├── nodekey
    │   ├── passwords.txt
    │   ├── genesis.json
    │   ├── static-nodes.json
    │   └── permissioned-nodes.json
    ├── constellation/
    │   ├── tm.key
    │   ├── tm.pub
    │   └── tm.conf
    └── logs/

On the Docker host, a *qdata_N/* directory for each node is created with the structure above. When the network is started, this will be mapped by the *docker-compose.yml* file to each container's internal */qdata/* directory.

### Adding new nodes to an existing network

The docker image jpmorganchase/quorum uses a startup script that is designed to start the node in one of the following two modes:
1. part of the initial Raft cluster. Notice in the docker-compose.yml file, the following command is used for this purpose:
```
command: start.sh --bootnode="enode://c3475a286a...6ebc6@172.13.0.100:30301" --raftInit
```
2. new node joining an existing network. You can modify the docker service start command as the following:
```
command: start.sh --bootnode="enode://c3475a286a...6ebc6@172.13.0.100:30301" --raftID=5
```

Note: the number `5` is the placeholder of the Raft node ID returned by calling `raft.addPeer()` in the geth console connected to an existing geth node of the network.

### House-keeping

Delete any old configuration.
